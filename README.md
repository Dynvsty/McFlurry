# McFlurry
A simple python app to freeze a Minecraft instance by simulating a right click on the window bar.
This is the micro version, meant to be smaller than the original.
A whole 1 second faster! (***wow!!!***)


# Known Bugs
1). Most special characters not working in hotkeys (likely won't be fixed for a long time)
