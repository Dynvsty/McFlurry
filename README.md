# McFlurry
A simple python app to freeze a Minecraft instance by simulating a right click on the window bar.
This is the mini version, meant to be smaller than the original.
A whole 1 second faster! (***wow!!!***)

# Known Bugs
1). Most special characters not working in hotkeys (likely won't be fixed for a long time)

# Why

Instead of making the original better, I'll just make a worse version that takes up less space!! I'm a genius
